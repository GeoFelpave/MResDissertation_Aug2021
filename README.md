# ADD TITLE OF THE DISSERTATION

## Motivation, Aim and Objectives

The motivation of this study was the interest to understand how precipitation-related extremeswill affect water security, at regional scales, particularly in the creation of actionable knowledgefor policy and decision making processes (ADD REF, ADD REF). ADD REF, defined watersecurity as a condition based on the ability of the population to access adequate volumes of cleanwater to enable sustain livelihoods, as well as including the protection of livelihood against waterrelated natural disasters (ADD REF). Over the past two decades several studies have presentedresults showing a projected increase in the frequency and intensity of precipitation events (ADD REF), which the AR6 published by the IPCC in August 2021 corroborated by highlighting that’heavy precipitation events would become more frequent and more intense than in the recentpast, on the global scale (virtually certain) and in all continents and AR6 regions. The increasein frequency and intensity is extremely likely for most continents and very likely for most AR6regions’ (ADD REF TO AR6). However, before assessing the impact of precipitation-relatedextremes over water security at a regional level, a greater understanding of extreme precipitationconcepts and analysis techniques need it to be developed by the author of this study. From thisperspective, the main purpose of the present study is bifold. First; this study aims to enable thedevelopment of knowledge and understanding of concepts and elements of precipitation-relatedextremes through the evaluation of annual precipitation and extreme indices in the UK usingobservational, satellite-derived and reanalysis products. Second; to inform the development of aPhD level research in how precipitation-related extremes will affect water security at a regionallevel. The following are the objectives outlined for this study:•calculate the set of annual precipitation and extremes indices as defined by the ETCCDIfor the UK using gauge, satellite-derived and reanalysis products,•evaluate the spatio-temporal performance of the set of indices for each dataset based on (a)arithmetic differences and (b) descriptive statistics,•use the outcomes of the study to evaluate future research and development with regards tothe effects of precipitation-related extremes over water security.
